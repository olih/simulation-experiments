# Service Oriented Architecture

## Lessons so far

* External parameters in a json file is more practical than using program args
* Using a range of values allow to delay decisions about deciding which exact value would be best
* Randomness at a fine grain level does not feel efficient because it generates too many uninteresting solutions
* May want to try modeling (random) strategies for randomization that introduce constraints (ex: few refs, small payload, few services, ...)
* Representing the data visually could be challenging because of the multiple dimensions
* Some characteristics are hard to extract from the data as they may be subjective (ex: elegance of design)


## TODO next

* [ ] Decide how to visualize the data
* [ ] Implement some visualisation.
