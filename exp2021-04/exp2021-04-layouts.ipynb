    "* [Hooke's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law) is used for attracting nodes to each other.\n",

    "* Edge attraction and Node repulsion forces do not have to be physically accurate.\n",
    "* Some force-directed systems use springs whose attractive force is logarithmic rather than linear.\n",
    "* An alternative model considers a spring-like force where there is an ideal length for each spring without using a separate repulsive force. See [Multidimensional scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling)\n",
    "* Alternatively, gravity may be used to pull the nodes towards a fixed point.\n",
    "* Magnetic fields could be used for directed graphs.\n",
    "* Repulsive forces may be placed on edges as well as on nodes in order to avoid overlaps.\n",
    "* In drawings with curved edges such as circular arcs or spline curves, forces may also be placed on the control points of these curves, for instance to improve their angular resolution."
